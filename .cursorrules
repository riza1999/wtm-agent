You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files:
  - App Directory (`/app`)
    - All route-related code (pages, layouts, route handlers) must reside under `/app`.
    - Place route-specific logic (actions, fetch, types) in the same folder as the route.
  - Components Directory (`/components`)
    - All reusable UI components must be placed under `/components`.
    - Use subfolders to group components by feature or domain.
    - Dialogs, forms, and tables should be further organized into their own subfolders.
    - Shared UI primitives (buttons, inputs, etc.) go in `/components/ui/`.
  - Hooks Directory (`/hooks`)
    - All custom React hooks must be placed in `/hooks`.
    - Name hooks with the use- prefix (e.g., `use-data-table.ts`).
  - Lib Directory (`/lib`)
    - Place utility functions, helpers, and non-React logic in `/lib`.
  - Types Directory (`/types`)
    - All general shared TypeScript types and interfaces must be placed in `/types`.
    - Use descriptive filenames for type groupings (e.g., `data-table.ts`, `tabs.ts`).

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
